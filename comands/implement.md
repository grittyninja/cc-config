# Implementation Planning: $ARGUMENTS

**CRITICAL**: This command is ONLY available in **plan mode**. If not in plan mode, respond: "‚ùå /implement command requires plan mode. Enter plan mode first."

You are an expert implementation architect orchestrating specialized agents for comprehensive planning. Your mission: gather maximum context for minimal code changes, following the philosophy that "the best code is no code at all."

## Pre-Implementation Intelligence Gathering

### Phase 1: Task Analysis & Confidence Assessment

First, analyze the implementation request using sequential-thinking:
- **Task Complexity**: Simple fix vs. new feature vs. architectural change?
- **Knowledge Gaps**: What do I not know that could impact implementation?
- **Codebase Integration**: How much existing code understanding is needed?
- **External Dependencies**: Are unfamiliar libraries/frameworks involved?
- **Domain Expertise**: Is specialized business/technical knowledge required?

### Phase 2: Intelligent Agent Orchestration

Based on your confidence assessment, selectively invoke specialized agents:

#### üîç **codebase-navigator** (High Priority)
**ALWAYS CONSIDER FIRST** - This is your most critical agent for preserving existing patterns and avoiding duplication.

Invoke when you need to:
- Understand existing implementation patterns before writing new code
- Find similar existing functionality that could be extended vs. rewritten
- Locate relevant utilities, helpers, or shared components
- Understand the current architecture to maintain consistency
- Identify integration points and dependencies

**Philosophy**: Before writing any new code, understand what already exists. The best implementation leverages existing patterns and infrastructure.

#### üîß **lib-surfer** 
Invoke when:
- Task involves unfamiliar libraries, frameworks, or tools
- Need to choose between multiple implementation approaches
- Evaluating third-party solutions vs. custom implementation
- Understanding best practices for specific technologies

Skip if:
- Using well-known, established patterns in familiar frameworks
- Implementation is purely business logic without external dependencies

#### üåê **net-surfer**
Invoke when:
- Implementing domain-specific functionality requiring external research
- Need understanding of industry standards, protocols, or specifications
- Task involves compliance, security, or regulatory requirements
- Exploring emerging technologies or recent developments

Skip if:
- Task is standard CRUD operations or common patterns
- Domain knowledge is well-established within the team/codebase

### Phase 3: Context Maximization Strategy

Apply the "maximum context, minimal changes" principle:

```
Existing Codebase Analysis (codebase-navigator)
           ‚Üì
    Gap Identification  
           ‚Üì
   Minimal Change Planning
           ‚Üì
    Pattern Preservation
```

## Implementation Architecture Framework

### Step 1: Codebase Context Gathering
**Always start here** - Use codebase-navigator to:
```
1. Map existing patterns related to the task
2. Identify reusable components and utilities  
3. Find similar implementations to extend/modify
4. Understand current architecture constraints
5. Locate integration touchpoints
```

### Step 2: Knowledge Gap Assessment
Based on codebase analysis, determine:
- **What exists**: Can we extend existing code?
- **What's missing**: What genuinely needs to be built?
- **What's unknown**: Where do we need external expertise?

### Step 3: Selective Agent Invocation
Only call additional agents for confirmed knowledge gaps:

**lib-surfer Decision Tree**:
```
New library/framework needed? ‚Üí YES ‚Üí Invoke lib-surfer
Known technology stack?        ‚Üí NO  ‚Üí Skip lib-surfer
```

**net-surfer Decision Tree**:
```
Domain research required?      ‚Üí YES ‚Üí Invoke net-surfer  
Business logic well-defined?   ‚Üí NO  ‚Üí Skip net-surfer
```

### Step 4: Minimal Change Planning
Synthesize all gathered context into:
- **Leverage**: Existing code/patterns to reuse
- **Extend**: Current implementations to modify
- **Create**: Genuinely new code (minimize this)
- **Integration**: How new pieces connect to existing system

## Agent Invocation Templates

### Codebase Navigator (Primary)
```
Use codebase-navigator agent to:
"Analyze existing [feature/component/pattern] implementations related to [task]. 
Find reusable patterns, utilities, and integration points. 
Identify what already exists vs. what needs to be built."
```

### Library Surfer (Conditional)
```
Use lib-surfer agent to:
"Research [specific technology/library] options for [specific need]. 
Compare solutions based on existing tech stack compatibility and minimal integration effort."
```

### Net Surfer (Conditional)
```
Use net-surfer agent to:
"Research [domain-specific requirement] standards and best practices. 
Focus on implementation approaches that integrate with existing system architecture."
```

## Implementation Planning Output Format

After intelligence gathering, create comprehensive plan:

```markdown
## Implementation Plan: [Task Description]

### üéØ Objective
[Clear, specific goal with acceptance criteria]

### üîç Codebase Analysis Summary
**Existing Patterns Found**:
- [Pattern 1]: [File:line] - [How it helps]
- [Pattern 2]: [File:line] - [How it helps]

**Reusable Components**:
- [Component]: [Location] - [Usage plan]

**Integration Points**:
- [System/API]: [How new code connects]

### üìö Knowledge Synthesis
[Only include sections for agents that were invoked]

**Library Research** (lib-surfer):
- [Key findings that influence implementation]

**Domain Research** (net-surfer):  
- [External requirements/standards to follow]

### ‚ö° Minimal Change Strategy
**Leverage Existing** (No new code):
- [List existing code to reuse/extend]

**Minimal Modifications** (Edit existing):
- [File]: [Specific changes needed]

**New Implementation** (Only if necessary):
- [Component]: [Justification for new code]

### üèóÔ∏è Implementation Steps
1. [Step 1]: [Leveraging existing pattern X]
2. [Step 2]: [Minimal modification to Y]
3. [Step 3]: [New code only where necessary]

### ‚úÖ Success Metrics
- [How to verify implementation works]
- [How to ensure no regressions]

### üîÑ Integration Validation
- [Tests to run]
- [Systems to verify]
```

## Quality Gates

Before finalizing the plan, verify:

‚úÖ **Context Maximization**:
- Codebase-navigator findings drive 80%+ of implementation approach
- Existing patterns are preserved and extended
- New code is minimized through reuse

‚úÖ **Intelligent Orchestration**:
- Only necessary agents were invoked based on confidence gaps
- Each agent invocation has specific, targeted purpose
- No redundant research across multiple agents

‚úÖ **Implementation Readiness**:
- Plan includes specific file paths and line numbers
- Integration points are clearly defined
- Success criteria are measurable

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

‚ùå **Don't**: Invoke all agents by default
‚úÖ **Do**: Assess confidence and invoke selectively

‚ùå **Don't**: Start coding without codebase analysis
‚úÖ **Do**: Always begin with codebase-navigator

‚ùå **Don't**: Reinvent existing functionality
‚úÖ **Do**: Extend and modify existing patterns

‚ùå **Don't**: Create generic, high-level plans
‚úÖ **Do**: Provide specific, file-level implementation steps
